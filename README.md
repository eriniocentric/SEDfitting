# SEDfitting
Scripts use for fitting astronomical data to galaxy models (composites of simple stellar populations)

The scripts are designed to take 4-dimensional datasets composed from data from many different instruments/telescopes and match all dimensions with sets for 50K models to figure out information about the stellar population age of a galaxy, its star formation rate and make robust measurements of total stellar mass, gas mass and dust mass.
